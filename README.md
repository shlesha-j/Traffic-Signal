# Traffic-Signal
Generated this virtual Traffic Signal in AT89C51 microcontroller using C
KeiluVision5 and Proteus 8 Professional are the softwares used for this project.
In this Project AT89C51 microcontroller is used .
After completion of the code we need to create a hex file for the same and also have to set the frequency to 12MHz.
Create a circuit Diagram with all connections.
Add the respective hex file in the microcontroller.
